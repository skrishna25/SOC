# SOC Best Practices

This document outlines current best practices for operating a modern Security Operations Center. It is intended for teams responsible for security monitoring, incident response, and threat detection across on-premises and cloud environments.

## Log Collection and Visibility

- Collect logs from endpoint detection tools, firewalls, identity providers, cloud platforms, and SaaS applications
- Normalize and enrich logs with contextual data such as user identity, asset classification, and geolocation
- Use scalable, centralized storage with role-based access control and immutable retention
- Monitor critical paths including identity authentication, data access, and configuration changes
- Ensure full coverage of east-west traffic and container activity in microservice environments

## Threat Intelligence Integration

- Ingest curated commercial feeds, open-source indicators, and threat reports from ISACs or partners
- Use enrichment pipelines to tag alerts and artifacts with known threat context
- Track adversary behavior patterns mapped to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK
- Maintain a repository of internal threat data from prior incidents and red team activity

## Detection and Alerting

- Prioritize detection engineering using MITRE ATT&CK as a reference model
- Focus on behavior-based detections, not just signature or IOC matching
- Continuously tune rules and thresholds based on alert feedback
- Apply anomaly detection models where applicable, with human-in-the-loop validation
- Maintain high-fidelity detections across identity misuse, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and cloud abuse

## Automated Response and Orchestration

- Use SOAR platforms to automate repetitive tasks such as user lookups, ticket creation, and IP blocking
- Define response workflows for credential reset, host isolation, and MFA enforcement
- Integrate automation with IAM, EDR, firewall, and cloud APIs
- Use decision points to keep humans in control of high-impact actions
- Establish fallback procedures when automation fails or lacks coverage

## Staff Skills and Process Maturity

- Train analysts in detection development, scripting, cloud security, and incident response
- Define clear triage, investigation, and escalation procedures by analyst tier
- Encourage cross-training between detection engineers and responders
- Implement structured shift handovers and daily syncs to maintain continuity
- Use runbooks to reduce variance and improve speed of response

## Metrics and Quality Assurance

- Track metrics such as detection coverage, mean time to respond, and alert resolution accuracy
- Review false positive and false negative rates for all high-severity alerts
- Conduct regular quality checks on incident documentation and ticket notes
- Use detection-as-code practices with version control and peer review
- Periodically assess analyst workload to avoid fatigue and error

## Cloud and Hybrid Environment Coverage

- Monitor IAM activity, API calls, configuration drift, and container behavior in cloud environments
- Detect misconfigured storage, exposed secrets, and excessive permissions
- Use cloud-native tools (e.g., GuardDuty, Security Command Center, Defender for Cloud) to complement custom detections
- Secure access to SOC tools using zero trust principles and least privilege
- Validate detections using cloud-specific red team frameworks and simulations

## Playbooks and Documentation

- Maintain structured playbooks for common incident types including data exposure, ransomware, account compromise, and insider threats
- Include steps for containment, evidence collection, communication, and recovery
- Store documentation in version-controlled systems with access logs
- Review and update playbooks quarterly or after major incidents
- Align all documentation with regulatory and audit requirements

## Final Notes

The effectiveness of a SOC depends on visibility, skilled personnel, validated detections, and consistent execution. Regular reviews, red team testing, and automation help ensure the SOC adapts to new threats and supports business resilience.
