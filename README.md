# Active Directory 2025

This repository provides a structured view of Active Directory (AD) attack and defense techniques 

---

## Overview

The AD Mindmap 2025 outlines key domains in securing or attacking an Active Directory environment, mapped across tactics such as:

- Initial Access
- Account Discovery
- Credential Access
- Privilege Escalation
- Lateral Movement
- Persistence
- Defense Evasion
- Domain Reconnaissance

This Markdown version supports red, blue, and purple teams in understanding TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), aligned with real-world attack paths.
