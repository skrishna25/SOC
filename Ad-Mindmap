## Initial Access

- Phishing (spear-phishing attachments or links)
- Exploiting exposed services (e.g., RDP, VPN, web services)
- Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) abuse
- SCCM / MECM abuse

---

## Account Discovery

- Querying user and group membership via LDAP or PowerShell
- Extracting SPNs for Kerberoasting
- Using tools like BloodHound or ADFind

---

## Credential Access

- Kerberoasting via TGS requests
- Brute force and password spraying
- DCSync requests
- LSASS memory dumping (e.g., Mimikatz, Dumpert)
- NTDS.dit and backup file exfiltration

---

## Privilege Escalation

- Abusing ACLs on AdminSDHolder container
- Group Policy Object (GPO) abuse to elevate privileges or persist
- Exploiting trust relationships between domains
- Active Directory Certificate Services escalation

---

## Lateral Movement

- WMI execution and remote PowerShell
- PsExec, WMIC, and remote scheduled tasks
- Pass-the-hash and pass-the-ticket techniques
- Remote service creation and remote code execution

---

## Persistence

- Golden Ticket generation and reuse
- Skeleton Key implant in LSASS memory
- Creating backdoor service accounts
- Scheduled tasks configured for persistence

---

## Defense Evasion

- Clearing or tampering with security logs
- Deactivating auditing policies or log forwarding
- Modifying SID history on user accounts
- Hiding malicious accounts or C2 activity

---

## Domain Understanding and Recon

- Site enumeration and replication topology discovery
- Identifying trust relationships between domains
- Global Catalog and DNS information gathering
- Enumerating FSMO roles and domain controller configuration
